This project is an Alexa skill that will prompt the user to play a card game.  Alexa will provide a card to the user and will then ask the user to
 guess if the value of the next card will be higher or lower than the previous one.  If the user guesses correctly then the game continues until the user loses.
Scoring is based on the probability of guessing incorrectly (riskier guesses result in a higher score - but with an increased likelihood of being incorrect).  
The skill should keep track of the current streak of guesses and should also track the highest streak and score reached by the player.
